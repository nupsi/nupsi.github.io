This included disassembling and inspecting existing maps and searching for information online. The resulting map includes mechanics created using the entities included in the game and by scripting custom mechanics using the scripting language VScript.

The main aim of this project was to create a single script physics based first person controller for the Unity game engine. The project can be used at the beginning of a project to test first person movement. At the time of the release most of the other free alternatives and tutorials used either Charachter Controller component or directly manipulated the velocity of the rigidbody component. These can lead into unexpected results when interacting with other physics objects. The projects implements movement by only adding force to the ridigbody, which means other physics functions can affect the rigidbody without the users input overriding them. The project also solves a jittery camera problem by smoothly moving the camera to the current position separate from the rigidbody.","links":[{"url":"https://github.com/nupsi/FPController","text":"GitHub"}],"tags":["C#","Visual Studio","Unity","Git"]},{"name":"Constellation","year":"2018","description":"Committed code to a open-source project and was part of the development team.
